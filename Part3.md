# Part 3
## Intended Audience:
The audience for the final data story includes policymakers, Boston residents, and tourists. Each group has distinct needs and perspectives on the data. Because I did not have access to such a unique target audience, I can only be inspired by some statistical websites about Boston crime data, and analyze the time, place and crime characteristics to think about the problem from the perspective of intended audience.

The biggest headache for me is how to find appropriate data so that I can express a data story with clear and reasonable logical thinking. In order to better obtain the data I want in crime location analysis, I looked around for an outline map of Boston's Police district, so that from the perspective of data visualization, the audience can obtain and understand the information more intuitively, and also allow them to feel that data is not a cold number, but a tool that can bring the warmth of information

## Design Decisions
In fact, I originally wanted to tell the story simply from the perspective of time, place and crime classification, because through this logical chain, the audience can follow the ideas of my data story and understand what I want to express through the data. information, but after passing the interview, I found that there are still some detailed ideas that need to be modified, such as:
### Contextualization: 
Added benchmarks and comparisons to provide a better understanding of the data in a broader context, such as trends over time or comparisons with other cities.
### Narrative Flow: 
Improved the story flow to guide readers smoothly from introduction to conclusion, ensuring a logical and engaging progression of information.
### Call to Action: 
Incorporated actionable insights and recommendations, especially for policymakers and community leaders, based on the data findings.

In addition, I considered providing a motive for this story, so that the whole story forms a logical chain.
