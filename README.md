# About me
My name is Haipei Zhong, and I am currently a student in the Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I believe that mastering the art of data storytelling is crucial for making data-driven decisions and presenting information in a way that is both informative and accessible to various audiences.
