- Communicating insights effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

3. Practical Application of Theories

- Enhancing skills in data-driven storytelling for business decisions.

4. Ethical Considerations in Data Presentation
- Learning about the ethics of data representation.
- Ensuring integrity and avoiding misleading interpretations in data storytelling.

5. Peer Learning and Feedback
