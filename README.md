# About me
My name is Haipei Zhong, and I am currently a student in the Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) program at Carnegie Mellon University. My academic journey and interests have been steering me towards a career in the field of data. Through this course, I hope to learn how to effectively communicate complex data insights in a clear and engaging manner. I believe that mastering the art of data storytelling is crucial for making data-driven decisions and presenting information in a way that is both informative and accessible to various audiences.
